# QB Logs

QB Logs stems from my experience as a college quarterback. While Hudl excels at film review, I saw an opportunity to enhance how offensive data from games and practices is analyzed. By integrating film review with data insights, the goal is to create a tool that shortens feedback loops and improves team alignment.

**Motto:** "Practice analytically, perform intuitively."
